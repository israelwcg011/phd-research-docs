Solving the Vlasov equation: a machine learning approach
========================================================

Hello! I'm Israel. I'm a Physics PHD candidate at University of Bras√≠lia, Brazil.
My research project is about solving the Vlasov equation using machine learning
techniques. I'm building this website to help others understand better what I do
and also to serve as complementary information to the final phd thesis. Here you
will find periodical reports, python simulations and theoretical explanations.

   This web page is under development in the following period: second semester of
