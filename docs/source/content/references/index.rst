.. epigraph::
    A new computational method for determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the
    Schrodinger equation is described. Conventional methods for solving this problem rely on
    diagonalization of a Hamiltonian matrix or iterative numerical solutions of a time independent
    wave equation. The new method, in contrast, is based on the spectral properties of solutions to
    the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The method requires the computation of a
    correlation function :math:`\langle \psi(\vec{r}, 0)| \psi(\vec{r}, t) \rangle` from a numerical solution :math:`\psi(\vec{r}, t)`. 
    Fourier analysis of this
    correlation function reveals a set of resonant peaks that correspond to the stationary states of
    the system. Analysis of the location of these peaks reveals the eigenvalues with high accuracy.
    Additional Fourier transforms of :math:`\psi(\vec{r},t)` with respect to time generate the eigenfunctions. The
    effectiveness of the method is demonstrated for a one-dimensional asymmetric double well
    potential and for the two-dimensional Henon-Heiles potential.
